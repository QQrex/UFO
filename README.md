# UFO

## Overview

Dana has built a website that displays UFO sighting data. Her website already has the ability to filter for date but she has tasked us to expand on her website's filter table by adding the ability to filter for city, state, country and shape. Also, we made the website easier to use by removing the filter button and have the website listen for changes in the filter table inputs.

## Results

Upon arriving to Dana's UFO sighting website, you are greeted with the title of her website and a fun article on UFO sightings. The meat of her website is the data she has compiled on UFO sightings. To help her visitors quickly comb through her data, we have created a filter data table on the left side of her website.

>Filter table

The filter inputs have placeholder inputs, so the users have an idea of what type of data and formatting is used. Also, the filter table can take in multiple criteria to help users narrow down their search. Once an input is entered, the website should automatically listen for inputs and refresh the table based on criteria. Lastly, we included a refresh table button to quickly refresh the website and clear filtered inputs.

## Summary

In summary the website now has increase capabilities in filtering for data. However, a drawback we see is varying data types may cause users inputs data incorrectly or even a simple misspelled word could lead to an empty table. We can improve upon her filter table by adding menus of all possible data values. Also, we could work on adding duration as a possible filter criteria, but that would entail us to clean up her duration data as the formatting varies from seconds, minutes to hours.
